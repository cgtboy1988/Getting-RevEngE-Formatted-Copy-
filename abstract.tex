\begin{abstract}
Code obfuscation is a popular technique used by white- as well as black-hat developers to protect their software from Man-At-The-End attacks. A perennial problem has been how to evaluate the power of different obfuscation techniques. However, this evaluation is essential in order to be able to recommend which combination of techniques to employ for a particular application, and to estimate how long protected assets will survive in the field. We describe a system, \revenge, that generates random obfuscated challenges, asks reverse engineers to solve these challenges (with promises of monetary rewards if successful), monitors and collects data on how the challenges were solved, and verifies the correctness of submitted solutions. Finally, the system analyzes the actions of the engineers to determine the sequence and duration of techniques employed, with the ultimate goal of learning the relative strengths of different combinations of obfuscations.
