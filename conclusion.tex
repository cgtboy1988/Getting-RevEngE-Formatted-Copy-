\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

The field of code obfuscation and reverse engineering lacks confidence in methods.  Where many fields have demonstrated methods' efficacy through challenges of various types---particularly cryptography with the RSA Challenge---no such effort has demonstrated the hardness of different obfuscation techniques and, inversely, the strength of reverse engineering methods to counter them.

Here, we introduce the \revenge Competition, where we generate and serve reverse engineering challenges in order to fill this void.  By employing additional tooling such as novel data collection software and auto-grading capabilities, \revenge promises to efficiently and objectively evaluate participants' methods to defeat obfuscations applied to code.

{\em Sharing Statement:} The \revenge system can be accessed at \revengeurl. All the source code is freely available at \sourceurl. The binary for  \tigress used to generate challenges can be downloaded from \tigressurl (source code is available to researchers on request). Properly anonymized data generated by the system will be made freely available to the research community.
