\subsection{Obfuscation}
Obfuscating code transformations to protect assets in software date back at least to the early 1990s~\cite{falcarin2011guest}. Progress was initially driven by the needs to protect cryptographic operations in Digital Rights Management systems~\cite{horning05softwarea,chow02white-box} and to hide algorithms in easily decompilable languages like Java~\cite{collberg1997taxonomy}. Diversification also motivated engineers, both to protect operating system mono-cultures against attacks by malware~
\cite{cohen93operating}, and, interestingly, to protect malware from detection~\cite{Skulason92mutation}. 

The literature is rife with descriptions of obfuscating code transformations~\cite{collberg_surreptitious_2010}. They typically fall in three categories: {\em control flow}, {\em data}, and {\em abstraction} transformations. Examples of control flow transformations include {\em control flow flattening} which removes existing control flow ~\cite{wang00security} and {\em opaque predicate insertion} which adds bogus control flow~\cite{collberg1997taxonomy}. An extreme version of flattening is {\em virtualization}~\cite{yadegari15generic}, in which the obfuscator generates a random virtual instruction set (V-ISA) for the target program $P$, translates $P$ into this V-ISA, and generates a interpreter that executes programs in the V-ISA. Data obfuscations transform variables into a different representation, for example by encrypting them, xor:ing them with a random constant, or converting them into a representation based on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic~\cite{Zhou:2007:IHS:1784964.1784971}. Examples of abstraction transformations, finally, include class hierarchy flattening~\cite{FPS12b} and traditional optimizing transformations such as inlining, outlining, and loop unrolling.

%In this project we will use and extend the  Tigress~\cite{tigress} C-to-C source obfuscator. It is a freely available tool that offers a large collection of transformations. It has been used in many academic projects (LOTS OF CITES) and also in industry.
